# Setup
- install miniconda and create a new environment
- install numpy, pandas, jupyter
- download notebooks and data folder from github repository (can just download as zip file)
- start jupyterlab from terminal
- the github zip contains the solutions notebooks too, these are more for her future reference, the thought is that we will help if she gets stuck
